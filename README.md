# ASSIGNMENT #
<br/>
* Use Material-UI along with ReactJS (using create-react-app) for User interface  <br/>
* Populate a combo box (a SelectField in Material-UI) by calling a Node server that will simulate a database retrieval and return a list of names, or fruits or presidents or anything. There will be no database work involved. You will hard code the array that you return. <br/>

* Code the SelectField so that, when the user clicks on it, it opens (standard procedure) and shows the list returned from Node. <br/>

* Then, when the user clicks on an item in the list, display it in a pop-up dialog (also a Material-UI control) with a nice message like: You chose xxxxxx. The user should be able to close the dialog and repeat the process. <br/>
